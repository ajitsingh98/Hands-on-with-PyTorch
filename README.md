## Introduction

PyTorch is a popular open-source deep learning framework that provides powerful tools for building and training neural networks. It offers a dynamic computation graph, allowing for easy model customization and debugging. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to learning PyTorch, starting from the basics of tensors and tensor operations to advanced topics like building complex neural network architectures.

## Basic Tensors and Tensor Operations

In this section, you will learn about the fundamental building blocks of PyTorch: tensors. Tensors are multidimensional arrays, similar to NumPy arrays, but with the added advantage of GPU acceleration for faster computations. You will explore various tensor operations, such as addition, multiplication, reshaping, and more. These operations are essential for data manipulation and model training.

## Advanced Tensor Operations

Building upon the basic tensor operations, this section delves into more advanced tensor operations. You will learn about concatenation, stacking, transposing, and other useful operations that come in handy during complex deep learning tasks.

## Forward Pass and Backward Pass

The forward pass is an essential step in training neural networks. It involves passing input data through the network and computing the predicted output. The backward pass, on the other hand, is the process of computing gradients for each parameter of the network using backpropagation. This section will walk you through the forward and backward pass steps in detail.

## Loss Functions

A critical component of any machine learning model is the loss function. It quantifies the difference between the predicted output and the actual target labels. You will learn about various loss functions and how to choose the appropriate one for different types of tasks.

## Step and Optimizers

In order to update the parameters of a neural network during training, an optimization algorithm is required. This section will cover optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam, and how to perform a step in the optimization process to update the model parameters.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Regression

Regression problems involve predicting continuous numerical values. In this section, you will implement an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for regression tasks. You will build a model that can predict continuous output based on input data.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Classification

Classification problems deal with predicting discrete categories or labels. Here, you will implement an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification tasks. You will build a model that can classify input data into different classes or categories.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Image Classification

Image classification is a common application of deep learning. In this section, you will build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify images into different classes. The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled images and will be able to predict the correct class for unseen images.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Classification

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a specialized type of neural network designed to process grid-like data, such as images. In this section, you will build a CNN for image classification tasks. CNNs are widely used for image-related tasks due to their ability to capture spatial patterns.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for Text Data

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are designed to process sequential data, such as text. In this section, you will implement an RNN for text-related tasks. You will learn how to use RNNs to generate text, perform sentiment analysis, and more.
